### A story of 1 Faulix island
One day, the king of MoMoland came to visit the grand island of 1 Faulix. The island is known for the villagers' teamwork and unity.
He said, " What a majestic island, I shall be the king of this land and build on my Momo empire." 
With all his might, he shoved his sword into the land, signifying that he owned the land from now on.
The proclaimed king of 1 Faulix Island went on to find shelter to spend his night in as the Sun was soon going to set.
On his way to the stream, he saw a group of tribal people dressed in red fabric, each with a sword in their hand. 
"What are you, peasant, doing on my island?" the leader of the tribe hollered at the intruder.
His fellow tribal members crowded around the man, discussing about the man's origins from his looks.
The king stared at the leader who looked tough and strong. Thinking that he would not be able to win in a fight with him, the king decided to make up a lie.
"Oh, I was lost in the thick jungle and wanted to find some shelter to sleep." he said pitifully, hoping that he would let him stay at their huts.
People from 1 Faulix are generally nice people, so they agreed to let him stay for a night. 
Thus, the king followed the tribe to their village. The place was nice and cozy with a campfire in the middle for keeping warm in the cold night. 
There was a smell of fried fish and potatoes which the villagers cooked in their stoves. Some was reading books while others listened to music.
The king thought to himself" It seems that 1 Faulix people are very nice. But to conquer this land, I will need to kill their leader in the most unsuspecting way possible."
Poisoning might be the best option. 
While the tribe sat around the campfire roasting marshmallows, the king slipped a small amount of ricin into his tea, grinded from some castor beans he got from Momoland.
He waited for the tribe leader to drink and when he saw him taking a gulp of tea, he smirked, thinking that his plan had succeded.
The tribal leader had already doubted the king when he met him and confirmed his intuition when he saw the mysterous powder in his tea.
He spat it out immedaiately and slammed the cup to the ground, shattering it into pieces.
He ordered a few men to beat the king up in a fit of anger. He had known that the king was up to no good from the start. 
Frightened by the sudden hit from the tribe, the king knew hia plan was discovered. He fled away from the 1 Faulix island and never returned again.
